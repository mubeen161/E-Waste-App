# E-Waste-App

Problem Statement: 
Electronic waste (E-Waste) is becoming a growing concern as the world becomes increasingly reliant on electronic devices. The increasing rate of technology obsolescence and the high rate of device replacement are leading to a rapid growth in the amount of E-Waste being generated. This presents a major challenge for waste management and recycling systems, as E-Waste often contains hazardous materials that can harm human health and the environment. In addition, E-Waste is often shipped to developing countries, where it is often managed in an unsafe and environmentally damaging manner. As a result, there is a pressing need for effective E-Waste management solutions that can reduce the environmental impact of E-Waste and promote sustainable practices.

Solution:
The E-Waste management system is a comprehensive solution that aims to tackle the growing issue of electronic waste. The application is designed to manage the entire E-Waste lifecycle, from collection to disposal, while reducing the amount of E-Waste that ends up in landfills. The system operates through a network of E-Waste collection points and government facilities, and provides users with a convenient and secure way to dispose of their unwanted electronics.

The E-Waste management system provides several key features, including data destruction services and safe disposal methods, as well as tracking the flow of E-Waste from collection to recycling. The system also offers educational resources to help raise awareness about the environmental impact of E-Waste and encourage responsible disposal practices.
